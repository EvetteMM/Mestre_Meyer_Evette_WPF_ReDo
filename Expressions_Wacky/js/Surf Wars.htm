//My husband and I are learning to surf.  If we each go out 3 times, calculate the average amount of minutes we each stay on our boards to see who surfs the best.
//Start with prompts to find out how long each person stayed on surf board for each try
var scott1 = prompt("How long did Scott stay on the surfboard on his first try?");
var scott2 = prompt("How long did Scott stay on the surfboard on his second try?");
var scott3 = prompt("How long did Scott stay on the surfboard on his third try?");

var eve3 = prompt("How long did Evette stay on the surfboard on her third try?");
//Add each person's scores and divide by 3 turns.  Googled how to add variables and found how to add variables with parseInt on W3 site.  It worked!

//Create alert to give final results
alert("Scott stayed on his board an average of " + scottAvgTimeOnBoard + " minutes. " + " Evette stayed on her board an average of " + evetteAvgTimeOnBoard + " minutes.")
//getting really weird answers. can't figure out why when the math is straightforward
